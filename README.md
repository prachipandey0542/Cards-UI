# Cards-UI
This repository contains all my small UI card projects made using React.
Each card has its own folder like Card-UI-1, Card-UI-2, etc.
I created this repo to practice different types of UI card components and keep them organized.

# Card-UI-1
This is a simple User Profile Card made using React + Vite.
In this project, I learned how to use props to pass different data into the same card component.

# Card-UI-2
This project contains simple Job Opening Cards made using React + Vite.
In this project, I learned how to use props and the map() method to render multiple cards easily.
Using props and map() makes the component reusable and reduces repeated code.
